    <h1>SmartRelayControl – Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted">Last updated: <span id="date"></span></p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes how the SmartRelayControl iOS application
      (“the app”) handles your information.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>
      SmartRelayControl is a utility app that sends Bluetooth commands to a
      compatible relay module in order to control relay switching operation.
      The app is designed to be simple and privacy-respecting.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information We Do <em>Not</em> Collect</h2>
    <p>SmartRelayControl does <strong>not</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>create a user account or require registration;</li>
      <li>collect your name, email address, phone number, or contact list;</li>
      <li>collect your precise location or GPS data;</li>
      <li>track you across other apps or websites;</li>
      <li>use third-party analytics SDKs or advertising SDKs;</li>
      <li>sell or share any personal data with third parties.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Bluetooth and Device Information</h2>
    <p>
      The app uses Bluetooth only to discover and connect to the relay module.
      Bluetooth communication happens directly between your iOS device and the relay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any device names, MAC addresses, and status information are used
      <strong>only on your device</strong> to establish and maintain the
      connection. This information is not uploaded to our servers because we do
      not operate any backend service for SmartRelayControl.
    </p>

    <h2>4. On-Device Data</h2>
    <p>
      The app may store simple settings on your device (for example, preferred
      relay name or last used channel). These settings stay on your device and
      are removed if you uninstall the app or reset its data.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      SmartRelayControl is intended for use by adults to control a relay system. 
      The app does not contain content aimed at children and does
      not knowingly collect information from anyone under age 13.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Your Privacy Choices</h2>
    <p>
      Because we do not collect or store personal data in the first place, there
      is nothing for us to delete, export, or “opt out” of. If you no longer
      wish to use SmartRelayControl, you can simply uninstall the app from your
      device.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      If we ever change how SmartRelayControl handles data (for example, by
      adding diagnostics or cloud features), this Privacy Policy will be updated
      and the new version will be made available at this URL before the changes
      take effect.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Contact</h2>
