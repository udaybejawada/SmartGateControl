    <h1>SmartRelayControl – Privacy Choices</h1>
    <p class="muted">Last updated: <span id="date"></span></p>

    <p>
      SmartRelayControl is designed so that we do not need to collect or store
      your personal data. Because of this, your privacy choices are simple and
      under your direct control.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
      We do not collect personal identifiers, contact information, precise
      location, analytics, or advertising data. Bluetooth communication is used
      only to talk to your relay module and is handled on your device.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Opt-out of Data Sharing or “Sale”</h2>
    <p>
      We do not sell, share, or transfer your data to third parties. There is no
      advertising SDK and no data broker involved. Therefore, there is nothing
      for you to opt out of with respect to data sale or sharing.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Your Device Settings</h2>
    <p>You remain in control of the following choices on your device:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You can disable Bluetooth at any time in iOS Settings if you no longer
        want the app to communicate with your relay.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can uninstall SmartRelayControl to remove the app and its local
        settings from your device.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Access, Correction, or Deletion Requests</h2>
    <p>
      Since we do not keep personal data on our servers, there is nothing for us
      to access, correct, or delete on your behalf. If you have any questions
      about this or want written confirmation, you can contact us at:
